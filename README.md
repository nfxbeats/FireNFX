##Goals of this project

I want to provide an improved, centralized workflow for what I call **MIDI Looping**

MIDI Looping is simply recording MIDI VST Instruments  within the DAW - as opposed to recording live instruments and vocal/beatboxing. This is just recording looped music with a MIDI device.

## IMPORTANT!
NOTE: This is pre-release and will have bugs.

Latest Version: https://github.com/nfxbeats/FireNFX

##Features
All base features of the default Fire are still available. ie you lose nothing but gain the following:
- **Perfomance Area** proveds a harmonically scale driven area for playing notes. Features of the performace area include:
	- FPC pad colors automatically detected and used
	- control over velocity
	- Set a harmonic mode and root note (affects non FPC channels only)
		- 3 to 4 octaves of notes playing. You can set base octave 1-5, providing up to 8 full octaves of notes.
		- Chord Bar - on pad plays triads and displays the chord name. You can add 7th notes and invert chords as well.
- **Pattern Track Bar** gives you a way to quickly switch instruments and patterns
- **Channel Strip** provides the following benefits when in channel mode:
	- Set the pattern loop length
	- Mute / UnMute
	- Show / Hide  the Channel Plugin, Piano Roll and Channel Settings
- **Mute Strip** provides a quick way to control the mutes of all pattern tracks at once.
- **Progress Bar** gives you way to see where in the looping you are. It can also be used to move the transport to various locations.
- **Macro Bar** provides a variety of features used in various aspects. The macros are as follows:

Macro #|		Function | Function + ALT
---------|-----------|--------------------
1 | Set Velocity | Set Root Note
2 | Set Base Octave | Set Harmonic Scale
3 | Set Quantize/Snap | Toggle Note Repeat
