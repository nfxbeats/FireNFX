# AKAI-Fire-NFX
#
FireNFX is a project to enhance the existing AKAI Fire functionality with easy to use MIDI Looper style helper functions. As such, many of these features are already available to AKAI Fire users, except not all in one place and not designed with MIDI looping in mind.

Please see the "FireNFX Documentation v0.0.PDF" for details on installation and usage.
